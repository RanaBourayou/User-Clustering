Livestreaming and Video Recommendation System


Overview


This project is part of a PFE (Projet de Fin d'Ã‰tudes) aimed at developing a Livestreaming and Video Recommendation System. The system incorporates multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the most optimal recommendation strategy based on user preferences and behavior.


Features


Machine Learning Algorithms: The system integrates various machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and preferences, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
Dataset of Videos: A dataset of videos categorized by genre or theme is provided for testing and training the recommendation system.
Pretrained Models: A pretrained machine learning model is included to predict user preferences and interests based on historical data.
